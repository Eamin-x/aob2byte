# aob2byte

its just a simple tool,
original AOB look like this 62 6f 6e 65 5f 4e 65 63 73
but in c++ we need like this 0x62, 0x6f, 0x6e, 0x65, 0x5f, 0x4e, 0x65, 0x63, 0x73
this tool can convert aob from 62 6f 6e 65 5f 4e 65 63 73 to 0x62, 0x6f, 0x6e, 0x65, 0x5f, 0x4e, 0x65, 0x63, 0x73
and also it can reverse like this 0x62, 0x6f, 0x6e, 0x65, 0x5f, 0x4e, 0x65, 0x63, 0x73 to 62 6f 6e 65 5f 4e 65 63 73
i hope its workable for you!
